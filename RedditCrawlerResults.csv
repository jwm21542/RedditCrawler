 Waste of talent. Their last release sold 36k which is more than decent for nugu girl groups. FNC killed them by only giving them 1 cb a year. Love So Sweet and Love In Space were bops. Same with Hands Up. I'd put Haeyoon/Bora up against any other 4th gen vocal duo. Jiwon is your visual's visual. May was next in the long line of giant maknaes. Remi was a super underrated dancer.

And that was with very little promotions and only one release a year. And FNC doesn't want to give them a shot at all?!?! This is just baffling. If they had dropped them during COVID, I would have understood. Many groups didn't survive that. But they came out getting stronger and stronger. And FNC just shelved them. So upset.

" trans by TMIKpop According to entertainment insiders, Hybe launched an investigation of Ador CEO Min Heejin and VP L on 22 Apr. Hybe audit team reportedly visited the workspace of the Ador's executives to retrieve computer assets and secure witness statements.
Allegedly Hybes audit team caught them leaking confidential contracts to attract investors and discussing ways to induce Hybe to sell its shares in Ador. Currently Hybe owns 80% of the Ador while the remaining 20% is held by Ador execs (MHJ was granted 18% last year)
Hybe believes that L used his position to pass insider information about Hybe to Ador. A CPA by training, L was part of the investor relations team in Hybes finance department and worked on Hybes IPO before moving to Ador earlier this year.
L is suspected of feeding Ador confidential documents, trade secrets and other info necessary to separate Ador from Hybe since he began at Hybe. He is reportedly referred to as Min Heejins right hand man.
Hybe plans to pursue legal action if necessary. additional reporting by Yonhap News, trans by TMIKpop Hybe confirms that they did initiate an audit against some executives due to a belief those executives were trying to take control of Ador. damn& now why would you bite the hand that feeds you this way",Reddit,0,16.07.7400,https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1ca2gc4/hybe_launched_audit_into_ceo_of_newjeans_agency/

She's certainly important to the group's success in a way that would be difficult to replace, especially if she takes creatives with her in some kind of exodus.

" Allegedly Hybes audit team caught them leaking confidential contracts to attract investors and discussing ways to induce Hybe to sell its shares in Ador. Currently Hybe owns 80% of the Ador while the remaining 20% is held by Ador execs (MHJ was granted 18% last year)
Hybe believes that L used his position to pass insider information about Hybe to Ador. A CPA by training, L was part of the investor relations team in Hybes finance department and worked on Hybes IPO before moving to Ador earlier this year.
L is suspected of feeding Ador confidential documents, trade secrets and other info necessary to separate Ador from Hybe since he began at Hybe. He is reportedly referred to as Min Heejins right hand man.
Hybe plans to pursue legal action if necessary. Hybe confirms that they did initiate an audit against some executives due to a belief those executives were trying to take control of Ador. Honestly, I really find ADOR to be an outlier to HYBE, similar to PLEDIS. But i'm surprised that Min Heejin, if true, is attempting to make ADOR completely independent from HYBE by leaking confidential/highly confidential documents to ADOR investors/execs, then HYBE prevents that by auditing her. We'll see what's next for this. I just hope that it won't impact the career of NewJeans who are enjoying success now with their discography and visuals that are fresh in the K-Pop world, which also makes them an outlier to any groups. Even though I wished that NJ would make songs with BIGHIT producers, I would probably miss the sounds that BANAthe label founded by MHJ's former SM colleague Kim Kihyun where 250 and FRNK are signed withmade for them and are instrumental to their success, if ever Bang PD or a new ADOR CEO takes over with a new creative direction breaking what MHJ has crafted.

" Doyoung of boy band NCT makes his solo debut today with his album Youth. To mark the monumental moment, Doyoung wrote the lyrics for his two of the songs, one of which began with a letter he once received from a fan. The letter began with, Dear Doyoung, my sea, Doyoung told reporters in an interview Friday at the headquarters of his agency, SM Entertainment, in Seongsu-dong, eastern Seoul. In the letter, the fan described Doyoung as the sea: a place vast, calm, blue, beautiful and peaceful, but simultaneously deep, dark and scary. Per the letter, Doyoung taught the fan how to swim on their own, to be OK floating around the world  and that inspired the artist to write the words of the song From Little Wave. Ive always wanted to bring that letter into a song, Doyoung said. Good interview. I also found his thinking behind not defining what type of album it is (as in mini vs full) interesting.
